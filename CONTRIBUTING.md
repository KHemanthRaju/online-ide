        ```
-   Run the backend server
    -   Navigate to the `backend` directory
    -   Run `npm install`
    -   Run `npm run dev`
-   The backend server will be running on `localhost:3000`
-   Run the frontend server
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory

## How to Submit a Pull Request

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3.  Make your changes and commit them with a clear message
4.  Push your changes to your forked repository
5.  Open a pull request against the main repository
6.  Make sure to include a description of your changes and any relevant issue numbers
7.  Wait for feedback from the maintainers
8.  Address any comments or suggestions
9.  Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main repository

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main directories: `frontend`, `backend` and `code-runner`. Each directory contains its own set of files and folders for the respective parts of the application.

-   `frontend`: Contains the React.js frontend code, including components, styles, and assets.
-   `backend`: Contains the Express.js backend code, including API routes, database models, and business logic.
-   `code-runner`: Contains the code execution worker, which is responsible for running user-submitted code in a secure environment.
